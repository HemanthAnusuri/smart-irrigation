# Smart Irrigation System ðŸŒ±

This project uses Arduino and a Soil Moisture Sensor to automatically water plants when soil gets dry. LEDs show the current status and a small motor simulates the water pump.

## Components Used:
- Arduino UNO
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- 2 LEDs (Red & Green)
- Motor (simulated)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## How it works:
- Soil sensor reads moisture levels.
- If dry, motor runs and red LED glows.
- If wet, motor stops and green LED glows.

## Code
Available in `smartirrigation.ino`.
